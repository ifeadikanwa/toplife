# TOPLIFE

TopLife is a life simulation game that allows players to take on the role of the main character and immerse themselves in the lives of multiple generations.
It is my large game development passion project and I’m very excited to share every step of progress.
It is still in active development.

## MAJOR FEATURES

### TIME

Time moves with the player’s actions. There are 24 hours each day and the player must make decisions about what to spend their time doing.

### PLAYER
The player takes control of one character’s life at a time (main character), every other character in the game would be a non-playable character (NPC). 

The game is designed so that when the current main character dies, the player can take over the lives of their direct descendant’s lives- children or grandchildren. That way the player continues to play for generations, living a unique experience in each lifetime.

Every character in the game goes through each of these life stages:
-	Baby
-	Toddler
-	Child
-	Teen
-	Young Adult
-	Adult
-	Elder

**Journal:** 
 
 A record of every event and action the player takes in the game is stored in the character's journal. This way the player can always look back on the lives of all their main characters.

Outside of survival stats, there are other attributes every character in the game has that make them who they are:
-	Appearance:
  
    Characters in the game have appearance features that are determined by their parents including eye color, skin color, hair color and height. 
    There are also features that are unique to character and not influenced by their parents like intelligence, attractiveness and athleticism.

-	Personality Traits:
  
    Characters have traits that determine how they might handle a situation that arises with the main character. Some personality traits are forgiving, unforgiving, generous, stingy, responsible, and irresponsible.

-	Stances:

    Characters have stances/opinions on various topics that will determine what actions they will take when certain situations arise. For example, a character who is against the institution of marriage will always reject the player’s proposal.

-	Body Modifications:
  
    Characters including the player can choose to get body modifications like tattoos and piercings.

**Home:**

The player can be homeless or live in a building that is owned or leased by them or NPCs.
Having a home gives the player benefits like storage space for their purchases, special interactions with residents of the home, and special activities that can only be performed in the home.

**Finances:**

The player controls the main character’s finances. They can have various sources of income and see what transactions they perform day-to-day. When the player gets married, they also gain shared control of their spouse’s finances and vice versa. They have access to loans for school, cars and houses. They also have possible recurring bills like rent, mortgage payments, and loan repayments.

### RELATIONSHIPS

The player can start and maintain relationships with NPCs. Family relationships are created by the game. The game generates every lone character with a nuclear family and then allows each character in the game to make decisions that will let their family grow. We keep track of families for generations and their connection to each other.

Some of the family relationships that exist include in-laws, parents, cousins, grandchildren, uncles.
